# Illuminate - Dark Patterns Buster Extension

**Illuminate** is a browser extension designed to empower users on e-commerce platforms by highlighting potential dark patterns. It aids users in making informed decisions by providing real-time feedback when the cursor hovers over elements suspected of being dark patterns.

## Features

- **Real-time Detection:** Illuminate actively scans the webpage and highlights elements suspected of being dark patterns when the user hovers over them.

- **User Empowerment:** Provides users with visual cues to identify potential manipulative design patterns on e-commerce platforms.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/illuminate-dark-patterns-buster.git
2. Open your browser and navigate to chrome://extensions/.

3. Enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner.

4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the directory where you cloned the repository.

## Usage
1. Activate the extension by clicking on its icon in the browser toolbar.

2. Navigate to an e-commerce platform.

3. Hover over elements to receive real-time feedback on potential dark patterns.

## Datasets
One of the challenges we faced is obtaining diverse and comprehensive datasets for training the model. The current dataset is obained from a public repository https://github.com/yamanalab/ec-darkpattern

## Future prospectives
We intend to have a option for users to add possible new dark patterns that they may find while surfing the internet. This will help the appication be able to stay updated as new dark patterns emerge in the future.
